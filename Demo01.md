>**FSLogix Profiles**
   - The AVD User profiles are being stored in an Azure File Share.
   - We are using FSLogix Container settings to map the User Profiles to Azure Files.
   - East User's profiles are stored in East region and Central User's profiles are stored in Central region.
   - Profiles can be shown from Azure Files using Azure Portal

      - Open any one of the Azure Storage Account in Azure Portal and navigate to **Networking**
      - Add the Public IP to allow list so that the contents of the Azure Files can be accessed from the Portal.

      >**Note:** Azure Files are configured to allow access only from AVD Subnets; hence, to be able to access the Azure Files from Azure Portal, the Public IP that is being used to connect to the Azure Portal needs to be whitelisted.

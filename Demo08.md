# AVD Management with Intune

## Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Intune is a cloud-based service that focuses on mobile device management (MDM) and mobile application management (MAM). You have control over how your organization's 
devices, including corporate devices, mobile phones, tablets, and laptops, are utilised. You can also define particular security policies to control applications. 

Intune integrates with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to control who has access and what they can access. It also works with Azure Information Protection to protect data. It is compatible with the Microsoft 365 range of products.

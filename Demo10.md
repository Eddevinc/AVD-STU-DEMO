# Microsoft Defender ATP 

Microsoft 365 Defender is an integrated, cross-domain threat-detection and response solution. It can aid in the prevention, detection, investigation, and remediation of sophisticated threats across Microsoft 365. It also acts in the prevention of attacks by reducing your attack surface and eliminating persistent threats. Then, it automates threat resolution across domains by combining threat data for a quick and thorough response.

It also frees up defenders' time to focus on proactive hunting and other critical tasks such as developing custom tools and applying proprietary tactics and knowledge to better defend the organization.

Microsoft 365 Defender combines functionality from existing Microsoft security portals such as Microsoft Defender Security Center and Office 365 Security & Compliance Center. The security centre prioritises easy access to information, simpler layouts, and combining related information for easier use.

## Microsoft Defender Security Center 

1. Open a browser and sign in to the [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://security.microsoft.com/homepage).

2. On the homepage you will have **Navigation pane** (select the horizontal lines at the top left of the navigation pane to show or hide it). Here you can explore the portal by using the menu options given in each section

![](media/upd10-1.gif?raw=true)

3. The homepage of the portal gives an overview of multiple items such as:

* **Microsoft Secure Score** is a metric that measures an organization's security posture, with a higher number of opportunities to improve it.
* **Users at risk** is basically a represntation of the information specific to the security risk of a user account.
* **Threat analytics** allows you to continuously assess and control your risk of being exposed to threats. Use the charts to quickly determine whether or not a device has mitigations.
* **Device compliance** chart helps you to review Intune device compliance status and troubleshoot compliance-related issues in your organization.
* **Active incidents** shows the latest incidents and alerts received by your workplace's devices. 
* **Devices with active malware** helps you to review Intune-managed devices with active, unresolved malware.
* **Discovered devices** 
* **Microsoft 365 Defender Feed** is a section where you can find what new with Microsoft 365 Defender.

Leverage the team's organizational experience and knowledge to find sophisticated breaches and create custom tools and response workflows--by using advanced hunting.

  Get started by selecting one of the example queries from the list or create your own queries using the schema that advanced hunting provides. In many cases, writing your own query is simply not necessary. You'll find a tremendous number of useful queries shared by the community, suggested by Microsoft 365 Defender, and shared by your team.
  
  
![](media/upd10-7.gif?raw=true)

* **Action Center:** To investigate incidents, Microsoft 365 Defender uses extensive cross-domain automation and artificial intelligence. In many cases, it can stop threats without the assistance of the security team. However, some remediations may require approval, which you can do in the Action Center.

* **Threat analytics:** Threat analytics is a built-in threat intelligence solution that helps security teams face emerging threats as efficiently as possible. You can identify and react to emerging threats by comparing your security posture to them, all in one place.

  * In here you can see a ribbon in the top showing activities such as **Ransomware, Phishing and Vulnerability**.
  * You will a information about latest threats, those which have high-impact, and an over all summary.

## Onboard devices in Microsoft Defender ATP using Microsoft Intune

You can onboard any version of Windows that Microsoft Defender ATP supports. However, you must have a Windows 10 Enterprise E5 or Microsoft 365 Enterprise E5 license.

Microsoft Defender ATP has some additional requirements that Windows 10 devices need to meet:

* First, Microsoft Defender ATP requires the Diag Track service to be running in order to report cyber data. That’s the default Windows configuration, so just double-check that you haven’t turned it off.

* Microsoft Defender ATP requires an Internet connection. Its sensor can use about 5 megabytes each day to talk to the cloud service, plus additional bandwidth for files and investigation packages(which are sent only if you request them).

* Last, even if Windows Defender Antivirus isn’t the primary antimalware product, Microsoft Defender ATP relies on its passive mode to scan and provide information about files. 


Connecting Microsoft Defender ATP and Microsoft Intune enables scenarios like conditional access based on threat levels, and it also streamlines the onboarding process, since you don’t have to manually perfrom it. You turn that connection on in both places.

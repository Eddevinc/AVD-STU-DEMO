# Microsoft Defender ATP 

Microsoft Defender ATP is a very effective post-breach solution that enables automatic endpoint detection and response. It identifies and remediates malicious activities on your endpoints automatically. It analyses the scope and potential impact of each attack, reporting on the various threats to your organization's devices and allows you to rapidly and easily counteract and remove the threats using advanced tools and automation.

Because it is hosted in the cloud, Microsoft Defender ATM is agentless and does not require any setup or infrastructure. The method employs 'endpoint behavioral sensors,' which are installed in each device's operating system.

These Windows sensors are constantly gathering data and passing it to your organization's own Microsoft Defender cloud instance.
Microsoft Defender ATP then examines the behavior of the programs that run on your organization's machines to see whether anything seems to be a threat.
